//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! SPC (stereophotoclinometry) SUM and LMK file contents
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//!
//! SPC is R. Gaskell's shape-and-landmark software, hosted by PSI. There is no formal published record
//! specification for the ASCII SUM/LMK files; the field meanings below are assembled from:
//!
//!   [WIKI]  The SPC Wiki, PSI: https://web.psi.edu/spc_wiki/  In particular the MAPFILES page, which
//!           documents the binary maplet header and so defines the maplet local frame shared with LMK.
//!   [GIANT] NASA Goddard's GIANT optical-navigation library, whose Summary and Landmark classes read
//!           these same files and document each record:
//!           https://aliounis.github.io/giant_documentation/utilities/giant.utilities.stereophotoclinometry.html
//!   [MEAS]  Measured in this repository against the archived 67P dataset in tests/data/sum_lmk, and
//!           locked in by the unit tests named alongside each field.
//!
//! Every field is tagged with how well its meaning is established. Please keep these tags honest: a
//! wrong assumption here shows up as a silent few-pixel bias, not as a failure.
//!
//!   [CERTAIN]    Stated by [WIKI] or [GIANT], and where it affects geometry also confirmed by [MEAS].
//!   [UNVERIFIED] Plausible reading, consistent with the data, but not stated by any source we have.
//!   [UNKNOWN]    Meaning not established. Parsed and carried, never interpreted. Do not use these
//!                without first establishing what they are.
//!
//! Units: the SPC files express all lengths in KILOMETRES. Where this reader converts to metres it is
//! noted per field, because the conversion is NOT applied uniformly - some fields are deliberately left
//! in kilometres, and mixing them silently costs a factor of 1000.
//!
//! Records present in the files but NOT represented in these structs:
//!   SUM "LIMB FITS"    - parsed into limbFitObservations_, but never converted to observations.
//!   LMK "MAP OVERLAPS" - skipped entirely. [WIKI] describes it as "the relative locations of
//!                        overlapping maplets", i.e. SPC's internal maplet-to-maplet ties. Of no use
//!                        without the maplets themselves, which live in the binary .MAP files this
//!                        codebase does not read.
//!   LMK "PICTURES"     - parsed, but redundant: the SUM side already carries the same measurements.
//!
//! The archived 67P fixture in tests/data/sum_lmk/real_67p has its LMK PICTURES sections trimmed out and
//! contains no SUM LIMB FITS sections, so neither is covered by the real-data tests.

//! Tolerance for the orthonormality and determinant checks on a SUM CX/CY/CZ attitude matrix.
//!
//! The SPC archive contains valid matrices with a Frobenius orthogonality error just below 8e-8,
//! due to its stored numerical precision. This tolerance admits those matrices while still
//! rejecting matrices that are materially non-rotational.
constexpr double sumCameraRotationMatrixTolerance = 1.0E-7;

//! Tolerance for the orthonormality and determinant checks on an LMK UX/UY/UZ landmark frame.
//!
//! Deliberately looser than sumCameraRotationMatrixTolerance. The worst orthonormality error across
//! the archived LMK files is 2.3e-7, so reusing the camera tolerance here would reject the majority
//! of real landmark files while still admitting nothing that a 1e-6 check would not.

    //!
    //! MIND THE SIGN. The spacecraft position relative to the target centre is -spacecraftObjectVector_,

    //! [CERTAIN] SIGMA_VSO: SPC's 1-sigma formal uncertainty on SCOBJ. [GIANT]

    //! SCOBJ's unit - which no source states outright, though the archived values (21-34 m) are only
    //! sensible that way. One value in the file is expanded to all three components.
    //!

    //! sig_rot_target_fixed_to_camera, "Uncertainty on pointing rotation" - the quantity is documented,
    //! the UNIT is not. RADIANS is inferred from magnitude alone: the archived values are 1.0-1.9e-4,
    //! i.e. 21-40 arcsec or 5-10 px at the OSIRIS NAC focal length, which is the right size for

    //! [UNKNOWN] HORIZON: four integers, -1 -1 -1 -1 throughout the archived 67P dataset. Neither source

    //! [UNVERIFIED] SIGKM: a scalar uncertainty associated with the landmark position. [GIANT] sigkm,
    //! "The 1 sigma uncertainty on the landmark body fixed vector in units of km?" - THE QUESTION MARK
    //! IS GIANT'S OWN, so even that reader is unsure. Left in KILOMETRES, unconverted, because the field
    //! name carries the unit.
    //!
    //! Distinct from landmarkPositionSigma_ and NOT interchangeable with it. Across the 40 archived
    //! landmarks SIGKM spans 1.25e-3 to 5.0e-3 km and SIGMA_LMK 2.2e-4 to 7.9e-4 km, a ratio of 3.2 to
    //! 9.3 (median 4.7).
    //!
    //! [MEAS] hints at, but does not settle, which is which: SIGKM takes only THREE distinct values over
    //! all 40 landmarks, which is the signature of a per-landmark-class a-priori the operator chose,
    //! whereas SIGMA_LMK varies continuously as a solved formal uncertainty would. Suggestive, not
    //! conclusive - 40 landmarks from one arc is a small sample. This codebase does NOT use SIGKM; the
    //! landmark a-priori is built from SIGMA_LMK.

    //! RMS of the landmark body fixed vector in units of km?" - again GIANT'S OWN QUESTION MARK, and
    //! here [MEAS] actively contradicts the kilometre reading. Across the 40 archived landmarks the
    //! value spans 0.43 to 2.20 with a mean of 0.77; as kilometres that would be 430 m to 2.2 km of fit
    //! residual on a body only ~2 km across, which is impossible. Clustering around 1 instead points to
    //! a DIMENSIONLESS normalised residual (residual divided by its own sigma), which is about 1 for a
    //! well-fitted landmark. That is inference from 40 samples, not documentation.
    //!
    //! Left unconverted and unused. DO NOT treat this as a length without settling it first.
    double rmsLmk_ = TUDAT_NAN;

    //! [CERTAIN] VLM: the landmark position in the target body-fixed frame. Converted from km to METRES
    //! here. [GIANT] vlm, "The body-fixed landmark vector in units of km". This is the quantity the
    //! landmark position parameter (ground_station_position on the target body) estimates.

    //! [CERTAIN] UX, UY, UZ: the maplet local frame axes, each a unit vector expressed in the TARGET
    //! BODY-FIXED frame. They are therefore the COLUMNS of the rotation from the maplet local frame to
    //! the body-fixed frame, and localZAxis_ is the maplet plane NORMAL.
    //!
    //! [WIKI] MAPFILES states it directly: "Ux body fixed unit map axis vector", "Uy body fixed unit map
    //! axis vector", "Uz body fixed unit map normal vector". [GIANT] names the same quantity
    //! rot_map2bod, "The rotation matrix from the corresponding Maplet local frame to the body-fixed
    //! frame". [MEAS] rules out the alternative reading in which the three records are the ROWS: that
    //! would give an inward-pointing local Z for 6 of the 40 archived landmarks, whereas the columns
    //! reading gives an outward normal for all 40 (cosine with the outward radial +0.51 to +0.95).
    //!
    //! Beware of one thing the normal is NOT: it is not the line of sight. Across the archived
    //! observations it sits a mean 38 degrees away from it, so "the normal direction is the poorly
    //! determined one" is a conflation - the weak direction in an image is the line of sight.

    //! Orthonormality is checked against lmkLandmarkFrameTolerance, NOT
    //! sumCameraRotationMatrixTolerance: see that constant for why.

    //! sigma_lmk, "The 1 sigma uncertainty on all of the components of the landmark body fixed vector in
    //! units of km", stated without the question mark that sigkm and rmslmk carry. A single value in the
    //! file is expanded to all three components.
    //!
    //! Being body-fixed is what makes the landmark a-priori a plain diagonal on the body-fixed
    //! ground_station_position parameter. Expressed in the local frame it would instead be the full
    //! block U^T diag(1/sigma^2) U.
    //!
    //! NOT independent information: like SIGMA_VSO, it is an output of SPC's own adjustment of the same
    //! pixels being fitted, so using it as a prior double-counts the data to some degree. It is still
